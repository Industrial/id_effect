# Changelog

## Unreleased — 0.6.0 consolidation (breaking)

Narrows the workspace to its core purpose and hardens what remains. See
[ADR 0010](docs/adrs/0010-crate-tiers.md) and [docs/QUALITY_BAR.md](docs/QUALITY_BAR.md).
0.5.0 was never published; 0.6.0 is the next crates.io release after 0.4.0.

### Runtime fixes

- `run`, `run_with`, `ThreadSleepRuntime::default()` and the default `TokioRuntime`
  keep a caller-installed Compute Fabric. They used to replace it. They now call the
  new `ensure_default_fabric()`. `install_default_fabric()` still overwrites, and its
  docs say so.
- Telemetry is lazy and never sleeps. `SysinfoTelemetry` creates its
  `sysinfo::System` on the first snapshot, which returns a neutral CPU reading.
  Later samples reuse the cached reading until enough real time has passed. A cold
  `run_with` takes about 1 ms (was about 400 ms); the first Tokio spawn takes about
  3 ms (was about 200 ms).
- New: `ensure_default_fabric`, `installed_fabric::<E>()`, `is_fabric_installed`,
  `uninstall_fabric`, `SysinfoTelemetry::new` / `is_initialized`,
  `ComputeFabric::telemetry`.
- **Breaking:** `SysinfoTelemetry` is no longer a unit struct. Use
  `SysinfoTelemetry::new()`.

### Streams are pull-based

- `map`, `map_serial`, `filter`, `filter_serial`, `take`, `take_while`, `drop_while`,
  `grouped`, `scan`, `map_effect`, `state_scan`, `transduce_items` /
  `via_transducer`, all windows, and `merge` / `combine_latest` / `keyed_join` now
  emit incrementally and work on infinite sources. Previously each one collected its
  whole input first.
- `from_iterable`, `range`, `unfold` and `unfold_effect` produce lazily.
- **Breaking:** `Stream::from_iterable` requires `I::IntoIter: 'static`.
- New `Stream::from_pull` constructor and `PullFn` alias. `Stream::new` and
  `Stream::from_effect` are documented as single-batch.
- `take(n)` never asks upstream for more than it still needs. `take_while` stops at
  the first false.
- Streams end at the first error: the next poll returns `Ok(None)`. This includes
  `chain`, which used to re-poll the failed side.
- `from_channel` and `from_duplex_queue_channel` read one item per pull.
- Fixed: `merge` dropped the rest of the longer side after 64+ elements.
- `combine_latest` takes one chunk from each side per pull. It used to drain the
  whole left side first.
- `keyed_join`'s memory grows with the number of distinct keys, as documented.
- Time windows emit once the largest timestamp seen passes the window end.
  - `tumbling_by_time`: an item arriving after its bucket was emitted forms a new
    bucket.
  - `sliding_by_time`: items older than an already-emitted window start are dropped.
- Pulls respect a cancelled `CancellationToken` and yield to the executor while
  upstream keeps returning empty batches.
- `map_effect` runs nothing until the first pull.
- New test helper `id_effect::testing::assert_bounded_memory`.

### Tooling

- MSRV is declared: `rust-version = "1.94"`, checked by a CI `msrv` job.
- Every crate declares its tier in `[package.metadata.id_effect]`.
  `scripts/tier-conformance.sh` checks the quality bar for that tier.
- `scripts/readme-crates.sh` generates the README crate table.

## 0.5.0 — Process Mesh & distributed runtime (never published)

Semver-minor release introducing the **Process Mesh**: a BEAM/OTP-style local
process runtime (`id_effect_process`) and a distribution layer (`id_effect_node`)
for node identity, membership, remote processes, and distributed supervision.
Existing cluster/supervision/jobs/workflow stubs are wired into the mesh behind a
single placement scorer. See [ADR 0009](docs/adrs/0009-process-mesh.md) and
[book Part VII](crates/id_effect/book/src/part7/ch36-00-process-mesh.md).

### Added

- **New crate `id_effect_process`** — typed mailboxes, GenServer-shaped behaviors,
  links, monitors, `trap_exit`, exit-signal propagation, and multi-strategy OTP
  supervision trees, deterministic under `TestClock`.
- **New crate `id_effect_node`** — node identity, cookie-authenticated handshake,
  pluggable transports (InMemory/TCP/QUIC), SWIM membership, remote processes,
  process groups, and distributed supervision.
- **Unified placement API** — `id_effect::place` is the single pure entry point,
  fed by `LoadReport` (mesh telemetry DTO) with a `NodeCandidate` adapter. New
  `PlacementMode::RoundRobin` (deterministic rotation) joins `Affinity`,
  `LocalFirst`, and `Spread`.
- **Placement-aware distribution** — `mesh` gains `report_load` / `load_reports` /
  `remote_spawn_placed`; `DistributedSupervisor` places children via
  `id_effect::place`, honoring `spec.prefer` and excluding downed nodes on takeover.
- **Node-aware jobs** — `FabricJobRunner` honors `JobSpec.target_node` via
  `dequeue_for` / `pending_for`; `ComputeSupervisor::scale_out_placed` targets flow
  through to the runner.
- **Distributed workflow journal** — `RemoteStepJournal` backs `DistributedStepJournal`
  over a `JournalTransport` (`JournalServer` + `LoopbackTransport`) with a wire
  protocol and `WorkflowError::Transport`. `NetworkJournalStub` is retained as a
  test double.
- **`PgAdvisoryLease`** (feature `pg`) — `SingletonLease` backed by Postgres
  session-scoped advisory locks on a dedicated worker connection (CP production
  path). `MemoryLease` retained for tests.
- **`concurrency::RestartIntensity`** — shared sliding-window restart-intensity
  primitive (distinct from `RestartWithLimit`'s total-count cap).
- Examples: `132_distributed_supervisor_failover.rs`, `133_cluster_stream_fanout.rs`.

### Changed

- Capability API uses **service type names** directly: `caps!(Counter)`, `require!(Counter)`, `#[provides(Counter)]`.
- `Cap<T>` replaces generated `*Key` types; `#[capability]` is a no-op (removed from public flow).
- Trait-backed services use type aliases (`HttpClientService`, `ConfigProviderService`, …).
- `PlacementMode::LocalFirst` and `Spread` now diverge — previously they scored
  identically. `LocalFirst` prefers the least-loaded node; `Spread` picks lowest raw load.
- `id_effect_process` OTP supervisor delegates restart-intensity accounting to the
  shared `concurrency::RestartIntensity` primitive (behavior preserved).
- **Workspace versioning** — the root manifest owns `[workspace.package]`
  (version/edition/license/repository); every publishable member inherits via
  `version.workspace = true`, so future bumps propagate atomically.

### Removed

- Public `*Key` types and `define_capability!`.

### Version alignment

| Crate | Version |
|-------|---------|
| `id_effect` | **0.5.0** |
| `id_effect_process` | **0.5.0** (new) |
| `id_effect_node` | **0.5.0** (new) |
| workspace adapters | **0.5.0** |

## 0.4.0 — Implicit parallelism (breaking)

Semver-major release collapsing caller-facing parallelism policy into **Compute Fabric**. See [ADR 0008](docs/adrs/0008-implicit-parallelism.md) and [book ch13-05](crates/id_effect/book/src/part4/ch13-05-parallelism.md).

### Breaking

- **Removed public `Parallelism`** and all `*_with(policy, …)` dispatch on collections, `vec`, `order`, and `Stream`
- **Removed deprecated `*_par`**, `Stream::map_par_n`, `Stream::map_par_adaptive`, and public `compute::effective_threshold`
- Bulk and stream-chunk ops no longer accept caller policy — Fabric's `should_parallelize_current` is the sole threshold

### Added

- `compute::dispatch::parallel_if_profitable` — central Fabric-aware Rayon dispatch
- `Stream::map_effect` — admission-bounded concurrent effect mapping per chunk
- EDG parallel codegen for independent bind sets (`join_binds2` / `join_binds3` / `join_binds4`)
- Default Compute Fabric installation in `run()` and `run_with()`; `ensure_run_context()` at run boundaries
- Book rewrite: [Implicit Parallelism](crates/id_effect/book/src/part4/ch13-05-parallelism.md); Compute Fabric cross-refs in [ch12](crates/id_effect/book/src/part3/ch12-00-compute-fabric.md)
- Example: `122_compute_fabric_effect_parallel.rs` (`Stream::map_effect` under Fabric)

### Changed

- Primary `map`, `filter`, `map_values`, `sort_with`, and related bulk APIs parallelize implicitly when Fabric says it is profitable
- `effect!` may run independent `~` binds concurrently when the EDG finds no data or capability conflict
- `*_serial` and `#[effect(serial)]` remain the explicit escape hatches for `FnMut`, non-`Send`, and ordering

### Migration (from 0.3.x parallel-by-default)

| Old | New |
|-----|-----|
| `Parallelism::…` | removed — trust Fabric |
| `map_with(Parallelism::Serial, f)` | `map_serial(f)` |
| `map_with(Parallelism::ForceParallel, f)` | `map(f)` |
| `*_par(f)` | `map(f)` |
| `Stream::map_par_n(n, f)` | `map_effect(f)` |
| `Stream::map_par_adaptive(f)` | `map_effect(f)` |

Prior [ADR 0006](docs/adrs/0006-parallel-by-default.md) bulk behavior is retained internally; the public policy surface is superseded by [ADR 0008](docs/adrs/0008-implicit-parallelism.md).

### Version alignment

| Crate | Version |
|-------|---------|
| `id_effect` | **0.4.0** |
| workspace adapters | **0.4.0** |

## 0.3.0 — DI maturity (breaking)

Semver-major release completing capability-first DI adoption. See [appendix-b-migration.md](crates/id_effect/book/src/appendix-b-migration.md) and [ADR 0004](docs/adrs/0004-provider-parity-and-cap-subtyping.md).

### Removed

- `CapEnv1…CapEnv6` — use `CapList` / `caps!(K0, K1, …)` only
- `#[capability]` / `*Key` types — use service names with `Cap<T>`
- `require!(env, K)` — use `require!(K)` inside `effect!` or `Needs::<K>::need(env)`
- `ctx!`, `req!`, `service_key!`, `Layer`, `Stack`, `Effect::provide`, `IntoBind` (legacy paths)
- `id_effect_config::ambient` — use `Env::scoped` / `build_env`

### Added

- `CapList` + unbounded `caps!` arity
- `Cap<T>`, `#[derive(ProviderSpecDerive)]`, `#[provides(Service)]`, `#[named("variant")]`
- `CapWiden` for capability-set subtyping
- `ProviderSpec::optional_requires`, `shared()`, `refresh_interval()`, `on_refresh()`
- Fiber/request scoped overrides: `with_override`, `with_fiber_and_override`
- `id-effect-diagnose manifest` with TOML/JSON + `--json`
- Examples: `042_effectful_config_provider`, `043_named_variant_providers`, `id_effect_axum` `020_capability_run_with`
- Expanded trybuild corpus (12 cases) under `tests/ui/`

### Version alignment

| Crate | Version |
|-------|---------|
| `id_effect` | **0.3.0** |
| `id_effect_platform` | **4.0.0** |
| workspace adapters | **0.3.0** |

## Pre-0.3 history — "2.0.0" capability-first DI

Internal milestone numbered "2.0.0" before the workspace settled on 0.x semver. It was
never published under that number; its changes shipped as part of 0.3.0 above.

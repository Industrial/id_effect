# Benchmarks

Performance gates for 0.7 against the v0.6.0 baseline (decision D9 in
`.maestro/specs/0.7/brief.md`). Criterion keeps its baselines in `target/`, so the
numbers that gates read are exported to JSON and committed here.

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `gates.toml` | The D9 gates read by `scripts/bench-compare.sh` |
| `v0.6.json`, `v0.6.machine.txt` | The v0.6 baseline and the machine it ran on (`b0-baseline-capture`) |
| `fixtures/*.json` | Synthetic exports for `bench-compare.sh --self-test` |

## Gates

`ratio = new / base` on the median time per iteration, so lower is better.

| Kind | Benches | Passes when |
|---|---|---|
| `budget` | `phase0/bench_effect_map_chain`, `phase0/bench_effect_flat_map_chain`, `gate/flat_map_depth_10k`, `gate/async_bind_64` | ratio ≤ 1.25 |
| `improve` | `gate/spawn_join_10k`, `gate/sleep_cpu_1k_x_1ms`, `gate/axum_request_oneshot` | ratio < 1.00 |
| `report` | every other listed or exported bench | always (ratio is printed) |

- **Noise (Q7):** a ratio that misses its limit by at most 0.05 is reported as
  `NOISE` and does not fail. A same-build comparison (ratio 1.00) therefore passes
  the `improve` gates; a real improvement shows as `PASS`.
- **Presence:** every id in `gates.toml`, `report` ones included, must exist in both
  files. A missing id is a `FAIL`.
- **Exit code:** `bench-compare.sh` exits 1 on any `FAIL` and 2 on misuse.
- **Waivers:** a remaining violation after the one optimisation leaf Q7 allows needs
  an explicit human waiver (H2), recorded in `REPORT-0.7.md`. The gate itself is
  not relaxed.

## Benches

| Package | Bench | Ids |
|---|---|---|
| `id_effect` | `phase0_baseline` | `phase0/*` |
| `id_effect` | `gate_core` | `gate/async_bind_64`, `gate/flat_map_depth_10k`, `stream/*`, `coord/*` |
| `id_effect_tokio` | `gate_fiber` | `gate/spawn_join_10k`, `gate/sleep_1k_x_1ms`, `gate/sleep_cpu_1k_x_1ms` (process CPU time) |
| `id_effect_axum` | `gate_request` | `gate/axum_request_oneshot`, `gate/axum_request_caps` |

## Workflow

Run everything through `devenv shell -- …` on the reference machine, with the
`performance` CPU governor, and run both sides in the same session.

```bash
# 1. The v0.6 baseline: bench/v0.6 is exported with `git archive` into .tmp/bench-v0.6
#    (no worktree, the shared checkout stays on its branch) and saved as baseline v0.6.
bash scripts/bench-run.sh --ref bench/v0.6
bash scripts/bench-export.sh --machine-txt docs/benchmarks/v0.6.machine.txt \
    v0.6 docs/benchmarks/v0.6.json

# 2. The current checkout, saved as baseline head into the same target/criterion.
bash scripts/bench-run.sh
bash scripts/bench-export.sh head .tmp/bench-head.json

# 3. Apply the gates.
bash scripts/bench-compare.sh docs/benchmarks/v0.6.json .tmp/bench-head.json
```

- `bench-run.sh --src DIR` benches an existing export instead, for example
  `--src .tmp/bench-v0.6 --baseline v0.6` to re-run it without re-exporting. The SHA
  recorded at export time (`.bench-sha`) is kept.
- `--only PKG:BENCH` limits the run; arguments after `--` go to criterion, for
  example `-- --sample-size 10` for a quick smoke run.
- `bench-run.sh` records the benched SHA in `target/criterion/.bench-run/<baseline>.sha`,
  which `bench-export.sh` puts in the JSON with the CPU, governor, `rustc -V` and kernel.
- Do not name a baseline `base` or `new`; criterion uses those directories itself.

## Self-test

```bash
bash scripts/bench-compare.sh --self-test
```

It compares `fixtures/base.json` with itself and with `pass.json` (both pass, `pass.json`
includes `NOISE` rows), and with `fail-budget.json`, `fail-improve.json` and
`fail-missing.json`. Each of those must fail on exactly its one broken gate.

# What Even Is an Effect?

You've felt the pain. Now let's talk about the cure.

An Effect is not complicated. It's not abstract mathematics dressed up in Rust syntax. It's a simple idea that, once you see it, you can't unsee.

**An Effect is a description of a computation, not the computation itself.**

That's it. That's the whole idea. Everything else is just consequences.

## The Recipe Analogy

Think about a recipe for chocolate cake.

A recipe is not a cake. You can hold a recipe in your hands without any flour appearing. You can read a recipe without preheating an oven. You can photocopy a recipe, modify it (less sugar, more cocoa), combine it with a frosting recipe, and share it with a friend — all without a single cake coming into existence.

The cake only appears when someone *executes* the recipe. Takes out the ingredients, follows the steps, waits for the oven.

An `Effect` is a recipe for a computation.

When you write `succeed(42)`, you're not "succeeding" at anything. You're writing down a recipe that says "when executed, produce the value 42." The 42 doesn't exist yet. No computation has happened. You just have a piece of paper with instructions on it.

```rust
use id_effect::{Effect, succeed};

// This doesn't compute anything — it's a description
let recipe: Effect<i32, String, ()> = succeed(42);

// Still nothing has happened. `recipe` is just a value.
// We can pass it around, store it, inspect its type.
```

The computation only happens when you explicitly run it:

```rust
use id_effect::run_blocking;

// NOW something happens
let result: Result<i32, String> = run_blocking(recipe);
assert_eq!(result, Ok(42));
```

## Building Up Descriptions

Because an Effect is just data — a description — you can transform it without running it.

```rust
let recipe: Effect<i32, String, ()> = succeed(42);

// Transform the description: "when executed, produce 42, then double it"
let doubled: Effect<i32, String, ()> = recipe.map(|x| x * 2);

// Still nothing has happened! `doubled` is just a modified recipe.

// Now run it
let result = run_blocking(doubled);
assert_eq!(result, Ok(84));
```

The `.map()` call didn't execute anything. It took one recipe and produced a new recipe that includes an extra step. Like writing "double the result" at the bottom of your cake recipe — the cake doesn't change until someone bakes it.

## A More Realistic Example

Let's see what this looks like with actual I/O:

```rust
use id_effect::{Effect, effect, run_blocking};

// This function doesn't fetch anything — it returns a DESCRIPTION
// of how to fetch a user
fn fetch_user(id: u64) -> Effect<User, DbError, ()> {
    effect! {
        let conn = ~ connect_to_db();
        let user = ~ query_user(&conn, id);
        Ok(user)
    }
}

// Calling the function doesn't open any connections
let description = fetch_user(42);

// `description` is a value we can hold, pass around, combine with others
// No database has been touched

// Only when we run it does the I/O happen
let user = run_blocking(description)?;
```

That `effect!` block looks imperative — it looks like it's doing things. But it's not. It's building a description of things to do. The `~` operator means "this step depends on the previous step completing" — it's describing sequencing, not executing it.

## The Key Insight: Separation of Concerns

This separation — description vs execution — is why the Three Horsemen from the last section can be defeated.

**Error handling** becomes part of the description itself. When you write:

```rust
let resilient = risky_operation.retry(Schedule::exponential(100.ms(), 3));
```

You're not adding retry logic to running code. You're modifying the *description* to say "when executed, retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff." The retry logic is baked into the recipe.

**Dependencies** become part of the type signature. When you write:

```rust
fn get_user(id: u64) -> Effect<User, DbError, Database>
```

That `Database` in the type says "this recipe requires a Database to execute." The compiler enforces it. You can't run the effect without providing a Database. No runtime surprises.

**Structured concurrency** becomes possible because the runtime knows what each effect intends to do before it does it. Spawning an effect doesn't fire and forget — it creates a handle to a structured task with clear ownership and cancellation semantics.

## What's in an Effect?

An `Effect<A, E, R>` carries three pieces of information in its type:

- `A` — the **Answer**: what you get if it succeeds
- `E` — the **Error**: what you get if it fails
- `R` — the **Requirements**: what environment is needed to run it

We'll explore all three in the next section. For now, just notice that an Effect's type tells you everything about what it does — success, failure, and dependencies — without you having to read the implementation.

```rust
// This type signature tells the whole story:
fn process_payment(
    amount: Money
) -> Effect<Receipt, PaymentError, (PaymentGateway, Logger)>

// - Produces a Receipt on success
// - Can fail with PaymentError
// - Requires a PaymentGateway and Logger to run
```

No need to read the function body to know what resources it needs or what errors it can produce. The type *is* the documentation.

## The Philosophical Shift

Traditional async code is imperative: "Do this. Then do that. If something goes wrong, handle it."

Effect code is declarative: "Here is what I want to happen, what could go wrong, and what I need. Make it so."

You're not commanding troops in real-time. You're drafting battle plans that a general (the runtime) will execute. And because the general can see the whole plan before executing it, the general can make smart decisions about resource allocation, error recovery, and cancellation.

This shift takes some getting used to. But once it clicks, you'll wonder how you ever wrote async code any other way.

Let's look at those three type parameters in detail.
